# Simple-Tkinter-Health-Bar
This is a very simeple tkinter health bar UI that I made
It works by pressing the +1 and the -1 button to shift(increase/decrease) the main healthbar in the middle

This requires tkinter:
pip3 install tkinter

This also requires python 3.7

launch the 'Simple-Tkinter-Health-Bar' and enjoy
